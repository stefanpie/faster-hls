`yosys-abc` in this `yosys-mimalloc/` directory is actually `yosys-abc-mimalloc`, built with mimalloc.
Yosys just hardcodes the name and path to `yosys-abc` binary to be next to the `yosys` binary, so we have to do this rename.

There is a way to allow external ABC binary by setting the `ABC` environment variable, but this only works when yosys is built with the ABCEXTERNAL option.
I can explore this in the future, but for now this is the simplest solution.
